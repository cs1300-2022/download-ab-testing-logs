    <h3>Important Notes</h3>
    <p>Depending on your alternative hypothesis, the t-scores may be in the opposite direction value. 
    This may give you a p-value close to 1, and, in that case, you would fail to reject the null (as these are one-tailed tests).
    </p>
    
    <p> 
    The grade report contains the fraction of the two points you receive for each question. To interpret your score report, multiply each fraction by 2 and take the sum.
    To determine these fractions, it uses the maxwell distribution and the complex error function, which exponentially tapers off the further you are from the correct answer. 
    This allows leniency for those close to the answer (i.e. missing a couple logs) but penalizes those who were significantly far from the correct answer (i.e. a major math miscalculation).

    <h3>Task Success</h3>
    <p> For this, you are supposed to use the <b>chi^2 test</b> since the data is naturally categorical. </p>
    
    <p>The task success rates were <b>(0.8072289156626506, 0.8536585365853658)</b> (for a, b)
    
    <p>Then, the chi^2 metric was <b>1.262169152716568</b>
    
    <p>From this, the p-value (using df =1) metric was <b>0.2612408986254223</b>
    
    <p>Therefore, you should <b>fail to reject the null</b> as the p-value is greater than our alpha of (.05). This means your <b>results were not significant</b>.</p>
    
    <h3>Time to Checkout</h3>
    
    <p>For this, you are supposed to use the <b>t-test</b> since the data is naturally numerical. </p>
    
    <p>From this, the averages are <b>(77170.96268656716, 85390.44285714286)</b> (a, b)
    
    <p>Then, the t-score was <b>-1.9811328241543973</b> (for a - b in numerator)
    
    <p>From this, the p-value (using df =271) metric was <b>0.02429167976472837</b>
    
    <p>Therefore, you should <b>reject the null</b> as the p-value is less than our alpha of (.05). This means your <b>results were significant</b>.</p>
    
    <h3>Time to First Cart</h3>
    
    <p>For this, you are supposed to use the <b>t-test</b> since the data is naturally numerical.</p>
    
    <p>The averages are <b>(22579.37837837838, 32093.364238410595)</b> (a, b)
    
    <p>Then, the t-score was <b>-4.276821195399697</b> (for a - b  in numerator)
    
    <p>From this, the p-value (using df =261) metric was <b>1.2793709585103357e-05</b> 
    
    <p>Therefore, you should <b>reject the null</b> as the p-value is less than our alpha of (.05). This means your <b>results were significant</b>.</p>
